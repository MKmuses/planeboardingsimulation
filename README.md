Airlines face the problem of loading a narrow tube quickly while most delay comes from overhead bag stowage and aisle blocking, not walking time. Simple “back‑to‑front” schemes look intuitive but actually create many full-stop jams as each passenger must wait behind whoever is currently wrestling with their luggage. Random boarding, or structured variants like WILMA (windows, then middles, then aisles), reduce both aisle conflicts and seat shuffling, slightly improving flow by spreading bag‑loading events along the cabin. More mathematically optimized methods such as Steffen’s algorithm arrange passengers in a precise back‑to‑front, alternating-row, window‑in pattern to maximize parallel bag stowage and minimize interference, achieving near-theoretical boarding speed in simulations. However, these systems collide with human idiosyncrasies: families want to stay together, status hierarchies demand priority groups, and many passengers ignore or misinterpret instructions, so airlines typically compromise with simpler, more “random-ish” methods that are slower in theory but workable in practice.
